It allows players to register their details, owners to register playground information, and the system to display available time slots for booking.\n\nThis project demonstrates object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts using three main classes:\n- Player\n- Playground\n- PlaygroundOwner\n\nand a Main class to handle user interactions.\n\n---\n\n## üß© Classes Description\n\n### 1. Player Class\nThe Player class allows a user to register as a player by entering the following details:\n- Name\n- Email\n- Phone\n- ID\n\nThis data is stored for later use when booking a playground.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Playground Class\nThe Playground class contains all relevant information about a playground:\n- Size (e.g., small, medium, large)\n- Location\n- Available Hours (time slots that can be booked)\n- Name (of the playground)\n- Price (per hour or session)\n- Cancellation Period (how long before playtime a booking can be cancelled)\n\n---\n\n### 3. PlaygroundOwner Class\nThe PlaygroundOwner class stores information about the playground owner:\n- Name\n- Phone\n- ID\n- Email\n\n---\n\n## ‚öôÔ∏è Program Flow\n\n1. The Player enters their personal details to register.\n2. The Playground Owner enters their personal and playground details.\n3. The system prints:\n \n Welcome to our Playground!\n Please select your slot as per available hours.\n \n4. Once the player selects a slot, the system prints:\n \n Done!\n \n\n---\n\n## üß† Concepts Used\n- Object-Oriented Programming (Classes & Objects)\n- Encapsulation (private attributes and public methods)\n- Basic Input/Output operations\n- Simple data validation (optional enhancement)\n\n---\n\n## üß∞ How to Run\n\n### If using Python:\n1. Clone or download the repository.\n2. Make sure all class files (player.py, playground.py, owner.py, and main.py) are in the same folder.\n3. Run the program:\n bash\n python main.py\n \n\n### If using Java:\n1. Compile all .java files:\n bash\n javac *.java\n \n2. Run the main class:\n bash\n java Main\n \n\n---\n\n## üß© Example Output\n\nEnter Player Info:\nName: Ahmed\nEmail: ahmed@example.com\nPhone: 01012345678\nID: 12345\n\nEnter Playground Owner Info:\nName: Omar\nEmail: omar@example.com\nPhone: 01087654321\nID: 54321\n\nEnter Playground Info:\nName: Green Field\nSize: Large\nLocation: Cairo\nAvailable Hours: 10 AM - 8 PM\nPrice: 200 EGP/hour\nCancellation Period: 24 hours\n\nWelcome to our Playground!\nPlease select your slot as available hour.\nDone!\n\n\n---\n\n## üèóÔ∏è Future Enhancements\n- Add database storage for player and playground data.\n- Add slot booking system with real-time availability.\n- Implement GUI (Graphical User Interface) for easier use.\n- Include payment system for booking fees.\n\n---\n\n## üßë‚Äçüíª Author\nDeveloped by Gasser \nGitHub: [your GitHub profile link here]\n\n---\n\n## ü™™ License\nThis project is open-source and available under the MIT License
